# Text-Api
Text Analyzer API Rest

With this API, you can insert a sentence, then the substring chars quantity, and it will be analyzed by its substrings and how many times it repeats on all the sentence.

On the /target folder is a fat-jar with an embedded Tomcat server (the default port is 8080), so you just open the command console on that folder and execute:
java -jar challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

No authentication needed.
